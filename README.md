## About Tenori

Tenori is being created from the ground-up with Japanese learners in mind. By using established methods like active recall, spaced repetition, and mnemonics, it aims to make the process of learning new Kanji easier & more efficient. With Tenori, instead of battling with complicated configuration files and outdated UI, you will be able to focus entirely on your studies.

#### ðŸš¨ This program is currently under intense development with official releases coming soon!
